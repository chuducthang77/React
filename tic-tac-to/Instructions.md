# This is a tutorial obtained from making a game called Tic-Tac-To. There are instructions and notes from this tutorial
------
## React component class/React component type: input (props) output (render method)
- Render: description of what we want to see (React element)
- JSX: any JavaScript expressions within brace inside JSX

## Constructor
- All components that have a constructor should start with super(props)
- button Onclick: built-in component 
- slice(): mutable vs immutable object

## Function components
- only contains render method without having its own state

## Taking turns
- Use short conditional statement: A ? B : C
